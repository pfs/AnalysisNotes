We present a novel technique for measuring the top quark mass ($m_{\rm t}$) using tracker-only variables.
The 8 TeV proton-proton collision data is used to select \ttbar events in the single lepton and dilepton final states. By reconstructing secondary vertices inside the selected jets and computing the invariant mass of the secondary vertex + isolated lepton systems we build a variable which is sensitive to $m_{\rm t}$
and which is expected to be robust to the main systematic uncertainties affecting the $m_{\rm t}$ measurement. In order to control the main systematic, pertaining the modelling of the b quark fragmentation and hadronization, we study charmed mesons reconstructed inside jets in \ttbar events.

\label{sec:datasetsandselection}

The analysis is performed using CMSSW\_5\_3\_15.

\subsection{Data analysed}
\label{subsec:data}

Collision data are analyzed using the FT\_53\_V21\_AN4 global tag while simulation samples
are processed resorting to the START53\_V23.
Data corresponds to the so-called ``Jan22 ReReco'' while
Monte-Carlo (MC) samples correspond to the official CMS Summer12\_DR53X production.

We use double lepton primary datasets for the analysis as listed in Table~\ref{tab:datasamples}. 
Data are pre-selected for ``good" luminosity sections using the 
{\small Cert\_190456-208686\_8TeV\_22Jan2013ReReco\_Collisions12\_JSON.txt}
file which is centrally provided.

\subsection{Simulation samples}
\label{subsec:sim}

The MC samples for various background and signal processes relevant to this analysis
are listed in Table \ref{tab:mcsamples} along with the respective
cross-sections.
For the purpose of evaluating systematic uncertainties dedicated
samples are used. These are listed in Table~\ref{tab:mcsystsamples}.
The processes have been normalized to the NLO cross sections values listed in~\cite{twiki:STDMODELXSEC8TeV}
and the \ttbar cross section has been normalized to the NNLO+NNLL
computation from~\cite{Czakon:2013goa}.
Theoretical uncertainties (QCD scales and PDFs) are taken into account
for dibosons~\cite{Campbell:2011bn}, single top~\cite{Kidonakis:2012eq} and \ttbar~\cite{Czakon:2013goa}.

All samples are generated using the \MADGRAPH~\cite{MADGRAPH}, \PYTHIA~\cite{Sjostrand:2006za} 
or \POWHEG~\cite{Alioli:2010xd}
generators and a full simulation of the CMS detector based on Geant4~\cite{Agostinelli:2002hh}.

\subsection{Corrections applied to the simulation}
\label{subsec:simcorrections}

The pileup distribution in the MC is re-weighted to match the one
estimated in data.
After applying the re-weighting procedure the vertex multiplicity
distribution is used to evaluate the expected level of agreement.
Figure~\ref{fig:vtxmult} shows the resulting vertex multiplicity
distribution observed after the selection of two good leptons in the
event.
The lepton selection applied will detailed below.

\subsection{Event selection}
\label{subsec:evsel}

The event selection is briefly summarized in this section.
Table~\ref{tab:datatriggers} reports the triggers used in the
analysis.
The dilepton ($ee$, $\mu\mu$ or $e\mu$) and the single lepton ($e$, $\mu$) channels
are determined by both
the trigger and the offline reconstructed final state. Double counting
of the events is removed by giving requiring the trigger type to be matched
to the final state being observed
and giving priority to $e\mu$ over $\mu\mu$ over $ee$ events over $\mu$ over $e$, sequentially. 

\begin{table}[!htp]

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The offline selection is as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item at least one charged lepton is required in the event.
  Electron identification is based on a multivariate discriminator and we
  require it to be $>$0.5. For muons we make use of the Tight
  identification criteria. PF-based isolation is used in both
  cases. Electrons are required to have a relative isolation $<$0.15
  corrected using an effective isolation area and the event-by-event
  estimate of the energy density flow due to pileup and underlying
  event, \ie $\rho$. Muons are required to have a relative isolation
  $<$0.12 corrected using tracks which point to pileup vertices in the
  event.
  For single lepton events we require one lepton with \pt$>$30\GeV and $\lvert\eta\rvert<$2.5
  in the e channel or \pt$>$26\GeV and $\lvert\eta\rvert<$2.1 in the $\mu$ channel.
  For dilepton events we require two leptons with \pt$>$20\GeV, $\lvert\eta\rvert<$2.5
  and $M_{\ell\ell}>$12\GeV. In the case of ee or $\mu\mu$ channels, 
  events with $\vert M_{\ell\ell}-M_\cPZ\vert<15\GeV$ are rejected.

\item at least two (four) AK5 PF-reconstructed jets with charged hadron
  subtraction corrections and with \pt$>$20\GeV and $\lvert\eta\rvert<$2.5
  are required in dilepton (single lepton) events. The loose PF-jet id is applied
  as well as jet energy corrections. For the simulated samples we smear further
  the jet energy resolution. The smearing procedure is described in
  more detail in~\cite{twiki:JER}.

\item for same-flavour dilepton events we require further that \MET$>$40\GeV
  The missing transverse energy is computed from the absolute value of the \pt balance of all PF candidates.

\end{itemize}


The trigger and lepton selection efficiencies are determined from data
using a tag and probe method. The scale factor, with respect to the
efficiencies expected from simulation, is then used to re-weigh the simulated
events with two prompt leptons.
The Muon and EGamma POG recommended values are used~\cite{twiki:EGeff,twiki:MUeff}.

\section{Truth and Lies about Beauty and Charm: using top quark pair events as a spectroscope to
control the modelling of fragmentation and hadronization of $\cPqb$ jets}
\label{sec:truthlies}

We make use of the charged particle flow candidates associated to the two jets which rank highest in the CSV discriminator.
Particle flow classifies the charged candidates as electrons, muons or charged hadrons.
For the latter case we assign a mass hypothesis ($\pi^\pm$ or K$^\pm$) depending on the combination being tested.
Three charmed mesons are considered for our study:

\begin{description}
\item[$D^0$ candidates] - are chosen due to the large branching ratio, \ie 
${\rm BR}(B^+\rightarrow D^0+X)\times{\rm BR}(D^0\rightarrow K^+\pi^-)\approx 79\times3.9\%=3.1\%$~\cite{Beringer:1900zz}.
We reconstruct $D^0$ candidates assuming the $K^+\pi^-$ decay channel and using all the permutations
made of up to 5 leading-\pt charged hadrons. 
The purity of this selection is enhanced by finding a lepton with the same charge of the 
kaon assignment in a given permutation;
\item[$D^\pm$ candidates] - are chosen as the second most probable charmed mesons to be found after a B-hadron decay,
${\rm BR}(B^+\rightarrow D^++X)\times{\rm BR}(D^+\rightarrow K^+2\pi^-)\approx 9.9\times9.1\%=0.9\%$~\cite{Beringer:1900zz}.
\item[$J/\psi$ candidates] - are chosen owing to the expected high purity selection, stemming from the 
distinct final state containing two op. sign, same flavour leptons (e or $\mu$).
The reconstruction requires two leptons associated to the jet, in the conditions mentioned before;
\end{description} 

Figure~\ref{fig:charmedresonances} compares the data to simulation-based expectations for the invariant mass distribution
of the different charmed meson candidates. The agreement is overall good in the production rate and shape of the distributions.
The major discrepancies are observed in a slight shift of the $J/\psi\rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$ spectrum in data
and an overall 20\% excess in data in the region of the $D^\pm$ peak.

}
\label{fig:charmedresonances}
\end{figure}

In order to characterize the kinematic properties of these charmed resonances we make use of
the sPlot technique~\cite{2005NIMPA.555..356P}.
The invariant mass distributions are fitted to determine the contribution from signal and background.
In the fit both the parameters of the distributions as well as the yields of the signal and background  are determined.
The result is then used to unfold the contributions of the different sources to the distribution of a given variable
without using any a priori knowledge on it.
By applying this technique on both data and MC we are able to compare the results with different models.
Notice that the variable being unfolded must be, in first approximation,
uncorrelated with the mass distribution, otherwise extra correction factors would need to be applied.
Also notice, that to obtain a fully unfolded distribution which could be compared at generator level,
e.g. with the \textsc{rivet} framework~\cite{Buckley:2010ar}, 
an extra step would be needed of deriving possible
extra corrections between the unfolded sPlot distribution and the truth distribution in simulation.
For our purposes having a consistent setup in data and MC is sufficient. 
Moreover we don't expect these corrections
to be significant given we'll be using mostly tracker-reconstructed quantities. 

The signal is modeled with a Crystal-Ball function and the background with an exponential function.
An extended unbinned likelihood fit is used to extract the signal and background yields 
and fix the parameters of the probability distribution functions.
The fit is implemented in \textsc{roofit}~\cite{2003physics...6116V}.
Table~\ref{tab:charmfit} summarizes the average mass, 
width and the signal-to-background (S/B) extracted in data and
in simulation, for the different resonances.

The mass fit described above is performed in different \pt and $\eta$
ranges. Given there is a correlation between the invariant mass resolution and these
two variables we adopt this technique to measure the different $\pt$ and $\eta$
production cross sections for the charmed meson candidates.
The ranges are chosen such that the mean fitted does not deviate from the central value
quoted in Table~\ref{tab:charmfit} by more than 1$\sigma$.

Figures~\ref{fig:charmptdiff} and~\ref{fig:charmetadiff}
shows the results obtained for the $\pt$ and $\eta$.
Different models are compared with the data.
Overall data tends to agree with the prediction obtained with the \MADGRAPH+\PYTHIA+Z2$^*$ setup.
After changing the matrix-element generator
we expect differences in the kinematics of the mesons, in particular in $\eta$.
The result is not unexpected given \MADGRAPH is a LO generator including up to three partons at matrix-element level,
and \POWHEG is a NLO generator including up to one extra parton at matrix-element level.
Data tends to agree better with \MADGRAPH,
but, if \HERWIG is used instead as the hadronizer, the agreement with \POWHEG improves.
The variation of the tune for the same matrix-element+parton-shower choice (\MADGRAPH and \PYTHIA)
induces some differences in the spectra as well, with data being closer to Z2$^*$.

Using the inclusive $\pt$ and $\eta$ spectra we unfold different kinematics variables
of the charmed mesons which are, in first approximation uncorrelated to the reconstructed mass of the candidates,
given the variables are defined relatively to jet quantities:

\begin{description}

\item[Ratios to jet kinematics] - the ratios of the momentum, transverse momentum or longitudinal momentum of the charmed meson, with respect to the jet's momentum, transverse momentum or longitudinal momentum are quantities which are sensitive to the jet energy scale. We denote these ratios as $R_p$, $R_{p_{\rm T}}$ and $R_{p_{\rm z}}$ respectively;

\item[\ptrel] - the relative momentum of the charmed meson with respect to the jet axis is expected to be less sensitive to the jet energy scale and it is defined as:

\begin{equation}
p_{\rm T}^{\rm rel}=\vert\vec{p}-\frac{\vec{p}\cdot\vec{p_{\rm jet}}}{\vert\vec{p}_{\rm jet}\vert^2}\vec{p_{\rm jet}}\vert~,
\label{eq:ptrel}
\end{equation}

where $\vec{p}$ and $\vec{p}_{\rm jet}$ are correspondingly the charmed meson and the jet transverse momentum.

\item[Ratios to charged component in jet] - the ratios of the transverse momentum or longitudinal momentum of the charmed meson, with respect to the sum of all the jet's charged particle flow candidates' transverse momentum or longitudinal momentum are quantities which are practically insensitive to the jet energy scale. We denote these ratios as $R_{p_{\rm T}}^{\rm ch}$ and $R_{p_{\rm z}}^{\rm ch}$ respectively;

\item[Angular distance to the jet] - the $\Delta R$ distance is practicaly insensitive to the jet energy scale.

\item

The unfolded distributions are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:d0kinematics},
\ref{fig:d0lepkinematics}, \ref{fig:dpmkinematics} and \ref{fig:jpsikinematics}
for the $D^0$, $D^0$ with soft lepton tag, $D^\pm$ and $J/\psi$ candidates.
